# Large Language Models for Information Retrieval (LLM-IR)

`Project Overview`
This project explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhancing Information Retrieval (IR) effectiveness. We focus on two primary techniques:

`Query Expansion`: Using LLMs to augment search queries with semantically related terms to improve recall.
`Pairwise Re-ranking`: Utilizing LLMs to re-rank document pairs based on relevance to the query.

The system integrates multiple modules for data preprocessing, query expansion, pairwise re-ranking, and results evaluation using standard IR metrics.
